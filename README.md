My Interactive Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a showcase of my skills in front-end development, with a strong focus on creating dynamic, engaging, and innovative user experiences through modern web technologies and animations.


Key Features
This isn't just a static page; it's a fully interactive experience. Here are some of the key features I've built from scratch:

3D Rotating Hero Image: An interactive, 3D rotating element that flips on hover to display different images.
Dynamic Typing Animations: Real-time typing effects in the "Hero" and "About Me" sections that animate on scroll.
Interactive "Door Opening" Reveal: A stunning 3D door animation that opens when clicked to reveal the projects section.
Stacked Project Cards: A unique project showcase that displays one project at a time with a tilted "page peel" effect to navigate to the next.
Animated 3D Skill Cards: The skills section features two cards that are tilted in a 3D perspective and flatten on hover.
Live Proficiency Bars: Skill proficiency bars that animate from 0% to their final value when they become visible on the screen.
Animated Backgrounds: The entire site is layered on subtle, performant background animations, including a "digital starfield" and a "matrix-style" flow effect in the hero section.



Technology Stack
This project was built using a lean and powerful stack, with no external animation libraries. All effects are crafted with modern web standards.

Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
Styling: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first workflow.
Animations: All animations are custom-built using pure CSS (Keyframes, Transitions, Transforms) and JavaScript (Intersection Observer API for scroll-triggered events).
Graphics: Icons and some visual assets were designed or sourced from Canva.
